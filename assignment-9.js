// Q1. Explain the .map() function in JavaScript and provide three examples with detailed explanations.
/*The .map() function in JavaScript is like a conveyor belt in a factory. 
Imagine you have a row of objects, and you want to transform each one into something new.
You put each object on the conveyor belt, and as it moves along, 
a machine (the .map() function) modifies it. 
The result is a new row of objects that have been changed in some way.

Example: Doubling Numbers
Imagine you have a list of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4], and you want to double each number. 
Using .map(), you get a new list [2, 4, 6, 8]. The original list stays the same; 
the new list has the doubled values.*/


// Q2. Explain the .reduce() function in JavaScript and provide three examples with detailed explanations.
/*The .reduce() function is like a snowball rolling down a hill, gathering more snow as it goes. 
  It starts with an initial value (the snowball), then adds to it with each step until it reaches the bottom of the hill. 
  This function is great for turning a list of items into a single result.
  Example : Adding Numbers Together
  If you have a list of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4], and you want to add them all together, 
  .reduce() will give you 10 as the result.*/



// Q3. Explain the .filter() function in JavaScript and provide three examples with detailed explanations.

/*The .filter() function works like a sieve. It takes a list of items and filters out the ones 
that don’t meet certain criteria,leaving you with a new list of just the items you want.
Example : Finding Even Numbers
If you have a list of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], and you only want the even ones, 
.filter() will give you [2, 4, 6].*/
