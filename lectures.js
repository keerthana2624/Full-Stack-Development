// 1. History of JS
/* > In the early days of the internet, Microsoft offered a free web browser, which was attractive to users because Netscape's browser wasn't free. 
     Mosaic was a popular browser in 1990, but it wasn't free either.The creators of Mosaic later developed Netscape, which became known as Netscape Navigator.
   > JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich at Netscape to compete with Microsoft's browser. Initially called Mocha, it was later renamed LiveScript, 
     and finally JavaScript. Microsoft developed a similar language called JScript.
   > In 1997, JavaScript was standardized by the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA). Since then, it has been updated regularly according to 
     ECMAScript standards, with annual updates starting from 2016.
   > JS is very important for web development. It is used both on the front end (the part of websites users see) and the back end (with Node.js). 
     JS is versatile and works on both mobile and desktop applications.
